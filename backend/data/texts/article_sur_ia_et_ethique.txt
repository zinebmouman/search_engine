The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought forth new 
ethical challenges. Bias in training data, for instance, can lead to unfair 
or discriminatory outcomes in AI systems. It is crucial for researchers and 
developers to prioritize **AI ethics** and **data transparency**. Furthermore, 
the governance of complex AI models requires international cooperation. Ethical 
AI must be integrated from the start of the design process.
